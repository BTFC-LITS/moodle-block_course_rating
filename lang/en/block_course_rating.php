<p>The course ratings system is an initiative to improve the quality of courses on Moodle. This will
    improve the experience of the learner and lead to better success rates and student retention. Each
    course is graded with a medal: Gold, Silver, Bronze or In Development.</p>
<h2>What do these grades mean?</h2>

            addition contains activities which encourage the learner to collaborate with their fellow
            course mates and the teacher. In this way the learner contributes to the content of the course.</td>
